# CSC 497 Final Project

This is the coding portion for my final project in CSC 497. It is the front-end design of a web-mapping application designed to help UVic students find ideal locations for housing in Victoria, built with GatsbyJS.

## Packages Used

The application started with a [template](https://github.com/colbyfayock/gatsby-starter-leaflet) with [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/) and [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about) implemented. I utilized a [geosearch package](https://github.com/smeijer/leaflet-geosearch) to locate addresses on the map.
